# **A Tutorial on Regression with examples**

## **Linear Regression**

### *Only python*
The code for implementing and using linear regression written in python from scratch can be found in the reg-python dir.
The data dir inside reg-python contains a small example to help understand the model and code.
Following is a plot of the the data (in red) and output of the regression model (in blue) :

### *Using Scikit*
The code for implementing and using linear regression written in python using scikit library can be found in the reg-scikit dir.
The example dataset (diabetes dataset) used to demostrate the code and model is available in scikit and can be imported as shown in the code.
Following is a plot of the the data (in black) and output of the regression model (in blue) :

The MSE for this dataset using linear regression is 2548.07.
Varaince score is 0.47


## **ElasticNet Regression**

### *Using Scikit*
The code for implementing and using Elasticnet regression written in python using scikit library can be found in the reg-scikit dir.
The example dataset (diabetes dataset) used to demostrate the code and model is available in scikit and can be imported as shown in the code.
Following is a plot of the the data (in black) and output of the regression model (in blue) :
![elasticnet_reg](reg-scikit/images/reg_elasticnet.png)

The MSE for this dataset using Elasticnet Regression model is 5551.83
varaince score is -0.15


## **Lasso Regression**

### *Using Scikit*
The code for implementing and using Lasso regression written in python using scikit library can be found in the reg-scikit dir.
The example dataset (diabetes dataset) used to demostrate the code and model is available in scikit and can be imported as shown in the code.
Following is a plot of the the data (in black) and output of the regression model (in blue) :
![lasso_reg](reg-scikit/images/reg_lasso.png)

The MSE for this dataset using Lasso Regression model is 3482.77
varaince score is 0.28
